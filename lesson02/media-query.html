        <p>
          7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go
          and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
          Lord giveth no bcommandments unto the children of men, save he shall
          cprepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he
          commandeth them.

        <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
        <p>
          41 And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed
          and ahappy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For
          behold, they are bblessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual;
          and if they hold out cfaithful to the end they are received into
          dheaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
          never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are
          true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
