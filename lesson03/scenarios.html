      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The Teapa Chamber of Commerce's target audience is local businesses
        located in Teapa, Tabasco, Mexico, whether it is a start-up or
        well-established business. The website will be a place where community
        residents can find out more about businesses near them, and a place
        where businesses can network and be highlighted.
      </p>

      <h3>People</h3>
      <h4>Maria Campos - Restaurant Owner</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>35 years old</li>
        <li>Married</li>
        <li>Mother of 4 children</li>
        <li>Associate's in Culinary Skills</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        She has always wanted her own business and the quality of her restaurant
        is thriving, but feels she is lacking in the variety and amount of
        people who come. She hopes the site will bring more patrons and further
        promote her business. She spends most of her time perfecting recipes,
        managing the budget, hiring new employees and ordering shipments
      </p>

      <h4>Carlos Dionicio - Vice President of Marketing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>55 years old</li>
        <li>Married</li>
        <li>Father of 2 children</li>
        <li>Master's in Business/Marketing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While the company he works for is well-known and has been around for
        decades, he hopes to be provided with modern ideas and an opportunity
        for networking with other businesses. He manages many teams, coordinates
        meetings, sets up conferences, comes up with the business marketing
        plans, and delegates tasks to employees.
      </p>
